# Flashcards
This basic program allows you to keep daily track on learning your own flashcards.
## Attention:
- I use this program in vscode, in other environments f.e. CLion colors may malfunction.
- If you're using VSCode, please add path that this program is in as value of path value(11th line)
f.e. `string path="A:\\Adam\\Bob\\Cymon\\Damian\\";` I tried to fix it via launch.json and tasks.json in .vscode folder, by changing cwd in VScode's settings. I'll try to fix it later.
- I know about a bug that occurs when next year will happen, I'll fix it soon.
- If you notice any bugs give me a note.
